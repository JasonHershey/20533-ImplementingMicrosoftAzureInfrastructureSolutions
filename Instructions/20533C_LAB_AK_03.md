6. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want to target with the script.

7. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script might remove Azure services in your subscription. Therefore, we recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment, and prepare it for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, VMs, virtual networks and gateways, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it (you will see an error, if this occurs). If you still find objects after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the  **Reset-Azure** script, or use the full Azure portal to manually delete all the objects in your Azure subscription, with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you will have deployed Azure Virtual Machines by using Windows PowerShell and a Resource Manager template.
