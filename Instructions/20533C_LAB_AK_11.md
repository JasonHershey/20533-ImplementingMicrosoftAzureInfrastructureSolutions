#### Task 3: Reset the environment

3. Type the following command, and then press Enter:

  ```
  Reset-Azure
  ```

4. When prompted (twice), sign in by using the Microsoft account associated with your Azure subscription.

5. If you have multiple Azure subscriptions, select the one you want to target with the script.

6. When prompted for confirmation, type  **y**.

>  **Note:** This script will remove Azure services in your subscription. We therefore recommend that you use an Azure trial pass that was provisioned specifically for this course, and not your own Azure account.
> The script will take 5-10 minutes to reset your Microsoft Azure environment to be ready for the next lab. 
> The script removes all storage, virtual machines (VMs), virtual networks, cloud services, and resource groups.
>  **Important**: The script might not be able to get exclusive access to a storage account to delete it (if this occurs, you will see an error). If you find remaining objects after the reset script is complete, you can rerun the  **Reset-Azure** script, or use the Azure portal and Azure classic portal to delete all the objects in your Azure subscription manuallyâ€”with the exception of the default directory.

>  **Result**: After completing this exercise, you should have imported, published, and executed a PowerShell workflow-based runbook that deploys two virtual machines in parallel.
